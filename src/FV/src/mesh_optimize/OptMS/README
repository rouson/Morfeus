This library, known as OptMS, is a modified version of Lori (nee Freitag) 
Diachin's Opt-MS-1.0.3 code.  This library performs mesh smoothing and is 
used in the NEMO code.  The OptMS source has been modified to comply with 
ANSI-C and some of the more strict compilation checks of gcc 4.2.  For example,
all declarations of unused variables have been removed, a few macros have 
changed, and an explicit prototyping of malloc is now used.  The copyright 
notification of OptMS is below.
